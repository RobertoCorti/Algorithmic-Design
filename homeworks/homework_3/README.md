## Homework 03: Binary Heaps (second part)


#### How to compile

A `Makefile` can be produced by using `cmake` as follows:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" CMakeLists.txt 
```

The `Makefile` will be able to compile and generate the executable `new_heap_test`, that will perform a test of the implemented function in order to see if they are correct.
