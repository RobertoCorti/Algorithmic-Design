# Homeworks

The sub folders contain the report of the six mandatory homeworks and the requested algorithm implementation. 

* [`homework_1`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_1): matrix multiplication and Strassen's algorithm.
* [`homework_2`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_2): binary heap.
* [`homework_3`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_3): binary heap (second part).
* [`homework_4`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_4): sorting algorithms.
* [`homework_5`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_5): sorting algorithms (second part).
* [`homework_6`](https://github.com/RobertoCorti/Algorithmic-Design/tree/master/homeworks/homework_6): Dijkstra algorithm.

The explanation of each of these on how to execute each of these algorithms will be contained inside the `README` of the respective folder.
