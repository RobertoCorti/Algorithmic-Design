# Homeworks

The sub folders contain the report of the six mandatory homeworks and the requested algorithm implementation. 

* `homework_01`: matrix multiplication and Strassen's algorithm.
* `homework_02`: binary heap.
* `homework_03`: binary heap.
* `homework_04`: sorting algorithms.
* `homework_05`: sorting algorithms (second part).
* `homework_06`: Dijkstra algorithm.

The explanation of each of these on how to execute each of these algorithms will be contained inside the `README` of the respective folder.
